# CNN-Cosmic-Object-Identifier

Description:
This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning project focused on identifying cosmic objects using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project explores the application of CNNs in classifying astronomical entities such as planets from images.

Key Features:

Utilizes CNN architecture for image classification tasks.
Implements a deep learning model trained on a dataset comprising celestial images.
Includes pre-processing scripts for data augmentation and normalization.
Provides model evaluation metrics and visualization tools for performance analysis.
Offers a comprehensive documentation with step-by-step instructions for setup and usage.
Project Components:

Data Preparation: Scripts and utilities for data preprocessing and augmentation.
Model Training: Implementation of CNN architecture and training procedures.
Evaluation: Tools for assessing model performance and generating evaluation metrics.
Deployment: Instructions for deploying the trained model for inference.
Contributing:
Contributions to the project are welcome! Whether it's bug fixes, feature enhancements, or documentation improvements, feel free to submit pull requests.
